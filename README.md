javaScript / HTML / css EarTrainer App

Hello. This is a javaScript / jQuery eartraining app for musicians. It plays a string of notes for the user to play back by ear. It allows a lot of content and playback options for the user and will be useful for musicians at any level. The volume, playback speed, range of possible notes, key, scale, instrument, number of notes in the string, the length of the pause between strings for playback, and the number of notes in the string can all be set by the user. A user can start with a few notes, a small range, a slow speed, a long pause, and multiple repetitions of the string. They can then progress to more notes at a faster speed with a shorter pause. My goal is to consistently play back 10 notes at 70 beats per minute (BPM). I am just starting to get comfortable at 7. This has already greatly improved my playing. The next phase will add two and three not chords as well as a random option that mix single notes with two and three note chords.
